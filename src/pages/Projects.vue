        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>This page is a collection of a few items I've either developed in the past, am currently working on, or refactoring in some capacity. Projects are listed with the technologies I used to build said projects, as well as a brief description for additional context. Most of the times here are complete and are associated with previous client/agency work.</p>
