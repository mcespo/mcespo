Well hello there. As a real curious kid, I've been playing with static site generators to build new faster projects for clients. It's been a short amount of time but wow, [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) (Created by Hans-JÃ¸rgen Vedvik and his brother Tommy Vedvik) has been nothing short of a dream come true.

This has been way too smooth to be real but if all goes well, I make this my primary means to generate static sites.
